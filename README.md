--> Face Detection & Counting GUI using OpenCV + Tkinter
Project Overview :
I built a real-time Face Detection and Counting GUI Application using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter. This tool uses the Haar cascade classifier to detect faces through your webcam, visually count them live, and allows users to save cropped face images with a single click.

#Key Features:
1 Real-time face detection with bounding boxes and numbering

2 Dynamic face counter displayed on the screen

3 Save face images locally with timestamped filenames

4 Simple and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI)

5 Automatically creates a folder saved_faces/ for storing images


#Tech Stack:
Python

OpenCV (for face detection and video capture)

Tkinter (for GUI)

Pillow (for image rendering in GUI)


#Use Cases:
Automated attendance systems

Face data collection for training models

Entry-level computer vision learning projects
